## Arithmetic operators:

* Addition:

Adds together two values

`x + y`

* Subtraction:

Subtracts one value from another

`x - y`

* Multiplication:

Multiplies two values

`x * y`

* Division:

Divides one value by another

`x / y`

* Modulus:

Returns the division remainder	

`x % y`


## Assignment operators:

* =

`x = 5` is equivalent to `x = 5`

* +=

`x += 3` is equivalent to `x = x + 3`

* -=

`x -= 3` is equivalent to `x = x - 3`

* *=

`x *= 3` is equivalent to `x = x * 3`

* /=

`x /= 3` is equivalent to `x = x / 3`

* %=

`x %= 3` is equivalent to `x = x % 3`
